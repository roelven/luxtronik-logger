# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a resilient, fully-automated data-logging service for a Novelan heat pump using python-luxtronik. Key features:
- Continuous polling (30s default interval)
- Crash-safe time-series storage (buffer + cache)
- Daily/weekly CSV roll-ups with readable headers option
- Dockerized deployment
- TDD-first development (≥90% coverage)

## Common Commands

- Run tests: `pytest --timeout=10`
- Run specific test: `pytest tests/test_<module>.py --timeout=10`
- Build Docker: `docker build -t lux-logger .`
- Run container: `docker run --env-file .env -v ./logs:/app/logs lux-logger`

## Core Architecture

### Modules
- `config.py`: YAML/ENV config with validation
- `client.py`: Heat pump interface (python-luxtronik)
- `storage.py`: Buffer + cache management
- `csvgen.py`: CSV roll-up generation
- `service.py`: Main scheduler

### Data Flow
1. Poll heat pump (60s timeout, 3 retries with exponential backoff)
2. Validate data completeness and quality before storage
3. Store validated data in buffer → flush to cache
4. Generate CSVs with 1860+ sensor columns (daily @ 07:00, weekly)
5. Auto-delete CSVs >30d old

### Key Dependencies
- python-luxtronik
- APScheduler/sched
- SQLite/JSON

## Resilience Specifications

### Network
- 60s timeout with exponential back-off (3 retries)
- Detailed timeout logging (attempts + final failure)

### Crash Recovery
- Auto-restart service loop (5s delay)
- Preserve CSV generation state
- One retry on CSV failures

### File Management
- Auto-delete CSVs >30d (configurable)
- Log deletions (count + freed space)
- Disk space monitoring (<90% utilization)

### Testing
- 10s timeout enforcement in CI
- Detailed timeout reports

### Job Execution
- Ensure polling jobs do not skip due to max_instances limit
- Add timeout handling for long-running jobs

## Implementation Details

### Configuration
- Fields: HOST, PORT, INTERVAL_SEC, CSV_TIME, CACHE_PATH, OUTPUT_DIRS
- Validation: types/ranges, exit on invalid

### Client
- get_all_sensors() → Dict[str, float] (1860+ sensor readings)
- Proper luxtronik API usage with numeric indices
- Timeout logging with full context and retry details
- Data source tracking (API methods vs fallback)

### Storage
- API: add(timestamp, data) → (bool, List[str]) with validation results
- Data validation before storage (completeness, quality, critical sensors)
- SIGTERM/SIGINT handling (flush before exit)
- JSON serialization with proper error handling

### Service
- APScheduler/sched for intervals
- Graceful shutdown handlers
- Uncaught exception logging
- On-demand report generation support

### CSV Generation
- Daily: YYYY-MM-DD_daily.csv (last 24h, 1860+ columns)
- Weekly: YYYY-MM-DD_weekly.csv (last 7d, 1860+ columns)
- Skip if no validated data (log warning with validation details)
- Comprehensive data validation before generation
- Optional readable headers (human-friendly sensor names instead of raw IDs)
- When enabled, only mapped sensors are included in CSV output

## Future Roadmap
- 365-day retention (SQLite)
- Selective exports (sensor filtering)
- Web UI (FastAPI + React/Dash)
- Multi-format exports (JSON, DTA)

## Readable CSV Headers Feature
The system now supports human-readable sensor names in CSV headers through the `READABLE_HEADERS` configuration option. When enabled, raw sensor IDs like "calculations.ID_WEB_Temperatur_TVL" are replaced with descriptive names like "Flow Temperature", and unmapped sensors are excluded from the CSV output. This feature includes:
- Over 500 comprehensive sensor mappings for calculations, parameters, and visibilities
- When `READABLE_HEADERS=true`: Only mapped sensors appear in CSV output with readable names
- When `READABLE_HEADERS=false`: All sensors appear in CSV output with raw IDs (backward compatibility)
- All sensor data is always stored in the database regardless of CSV output settings
- No impact on data values - only headers and which sensors are included are affected

## On-Demand Report Generation
To generate reports on-demand (outside of the scheduled daily generation), use the command-line interface:

```bash
# Generate daily and weekly reports on-demand
python main.py --mode generate-reports
```

This will create the same daily and weekly CSV files as the scheduled job, using the last 24 hours and 7 days of data respectively. The command will:
- Query data from the SQLite cache
- Generate daily CSV with the last 24 hours of data
- Generate weekly CSV with the last 7 days of data
- Clean up old CSV files according to retention settings
- Exit after completion

This is useful for generating reports at specific times or for debugging purposes.

## Testing CSV Data Generation

### Simple CSV Generation Test
To test CSV generation with pre-populated data:

```bash
# Run the CSV generation test with test data
python tests/test_csv_generation.py
```

This test:
1. Creates realistic sensor data in SQLite cache
2. Generates daily and weekly CSV files
3. Validates the structure and content of generated CSV files

### Live Heat Pump Test
To test CSV generation with your actual heat pump:

```bash
# Run the live heat pump test (connects to 192.168.20.180:8889)
python tests/test_live_heatpump.py
```

This test:
1. Connects to your live heat pump at 192.168.20.180:8889
2. Collects real sensor data for 61 seconds (2+ data points)
3. Generates daily and weekly CSV reports
4. Validates the structure and content of generated CSV files

### Generate and Save CSV Files
To generate CSV files from your live heat pump and save them permanently:

```bash
# Generate CSV files and save to ./output directory
python generate_live_csv.py --output ./output

# Generate CSV files with custom duration (e.g., 120 seconds)
python generate_live_csv.py --output ./output --duration 120
```

This script:
1. Connects to your live heat pump at 192.168.20.180:8889
2. Collects real sensor data for the specified duration
3. Generates daily and weekly CSV reports
4. Saves the CSV files to the specified output directory
5. Shows a sample of the generated CSV content

### Docker-Based Test (Advanced)
To test the full workflow with a mock heat pump:

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test with mock heat pump
python tests/comprehensive_test.py
```

This test will:
1. Start a mock heat pump server
2. Build and run the Docker container
3. Wait for data collection (70 seconds for multiple data points)
4. Execute on-demand report generation
5. Validate the generated CSV files
