### Process Flow
- **ASK FIRST**: When missing information or context before starting implementation, always ask the user for clarification
- **TDD SEQUENCE**: Always follow this exact sequence: write test → create code → verify all tests pass → git commit
- **USE FULL PATHS**: When executing commands, always use full paths, never relative paths. Do not assume you're in the project directory

### Testing Constraints
- **10-SECOND TIMEOUT**: All unit tests must have timeouts. Test suites must not exceed 10 seconds total runtime
- **NO STUCK TESTS**: Implement timeouts to prevent AI agent from getting stuck on hanging tests

### Dev Rules
- Follow requirements to the letter
- Think step-by-step, describe plan in pseudocode, then confirm before coding
- Adapt to existing project conventions - read similar code first
- Search for existing types/interfaces before creating new ones
- Include all imports and proper naming
- Every implementation must be carefully thought through
- Every git commit requires a clear summary of the changes. Append every message with the following text:

### File Constraints
- **200-300 LINE LIMIT**: Refactor any file exceeding 300 lines
- **NO INLINE SCRIPTS**: Never write one-off scripts directly in project files

### Clean Code Mantra
Write code as if the person maintaining it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live:
- **NO CLEVER TRICKS**: Clear, obvious code only
- **COMMENT THE WHY**: Only explain why, never what. Code shows what
- **MEASURE THEN OPTIMIZE**: No premature optimization
- **SIMPLICITY FIRST**: Remove everything non-essential

### Refactoring Rules
- **EDIT DON'T COPY**: Modify existing files directly. Never duplicate files and rename them (e.g., `component-v2.tsx`)
- **STAY IN SCOPE**: Stay within the defined project scope, do not execute programs outside

### Logging Workflow
- **ADD DURING DEBUG**: Add logs during implementation/debugging phases
- **REMOVE WHEN STABLE**: Remove debugging logs once code is working and stable
